    %h1 Who counts the votes?

        You may know this famous quote, apocryphally attributed to Joseph Stalin:
        .quote Those who vote decide nothing.  Those who count the vote decide everything.
        Cynical, but essentially true.

            In a typical elections today, counting the vote is a strangely
            obscure process.  It happens behind closed doors.  Perhaps there
            are observers, perhaps there are auditors.  But if somebody cries
            "foul", there's no way for anyone outside the doors to really
            be ertain there were no errors or fraud.

            Instead, there are drawn-out arguments, legal battles, and acrimony, and the
            losing side feels like they were cheated.

        Fortunately, there's an easy solution using Open Data:  Make the
        ballot data open to anybody.  Then those who vote can also be those
        who count the vote.   Then <em>anybody</em> who wants to can count
        the vote of any election.
        %aside
          Actually, you'd probably use a computer to tally the ballots
          in the data set.  Computers are good at counting!
